# HR-department-on-PostgreSQL-JavaFX
It's a database of "Movie Store", part - HR department. Interface realised on JavaFX (ukrainian language).

There is two roles - manager and cashier(with limited rights). 
I will attach the diagram of database with all tables. In this project only one part (HR) realised.

When you launch the program, there will be login window, so enter login 'manager' with password 'manager' to see all possibilities.
We have 3 menu: Schedule, Guide positions and Staff. So we can:
-- hire and fire employee, 
-- create and change his schedule, 
-- add presence/absence on work,
-- see presence/absence of employee in hours for any date, week and month,
-- add and delete positions,
-- change position for employee
-- create a pdf file with guide positions table (using iText) and so on.
